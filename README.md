# Classification of possibilistic correlations in a tripartite scenario

## Introduction

>The possibilistic approach to the classification of correlations in networks allows the formulation of the marginal compatibility problem and the locality condition as boolean satisfiability problems (SAT).
The scripts solve such problems using the theorem prover from Microsoft Research (https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3.git).
